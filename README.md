# COR – Backend

Signal Processing • Machine Learning • Risk Intelligence

The COR backend powers cardiovascular risk estimation using smartphone-derived photoplethysmography (PPG), lifestyle signals, and machine learning–based trend modeling.

This service processes raw pulse waveform data and returns estimated blood pressure trends, HRV metrics, and cardiovascular risk insights.

---

## Overview

COR transforms smartphone sensor data into structured cardiovascular intelligence.

The backend is responsible for:

* rPPG signal preprocessing
* Feature extraction (HRV & pulse morphology)
* Blood pressure estimation
* Longitudinal trend modeling
* Lifestyle risk correlation
* Confidence scoring
* API responses to frontend dashboard

COR is designed as a screening and early-risk detection system, not a diagnostic medical device.

## Core Processing Pipeline

### 1. Signal Acquisition

* 10-second PPG signal from camera frames
* RGB channel intensity extraction
* Time-series signal construction

### 2. Signal Preprocessing

* Bandpass filtering (0.5–5 Hz)
* Noise reduction
* Peak detection
* Signal normalization

### 3. Feature Extraction

Extracted features include:

* Heart Rate (HR)
* Heart Rate Variability (RMSSD, SDNN)
* Peak-to-peak intervals
* Pulse amplitude variability
* Systolic upstroke time
* Pulse width
* Arterial stiffness indicators

### 4. Blood Pressure Estimation

Features are fed into a regression model such as:

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest
* Optional Neural Network extension

Outputs:

* Estimated Systolic BP
* Estimated Diastolic BP
* Confidence Score

### 5. Longitudinal Trend Modeling

* Rolling 7-day average
* Deviation from baseline
* Risk escalation detection
* Cardiovascular Risk Score (0–100)

### 6. Lifestyle Correlation Engine

Inputs:

* Sleep duration estimate
* Activity level
* Screen time patterns
* Food sodium classification

Outputs:

* Risk factor correlation
* Preventive recommendation generation

## Tech Stack

* Node.js / Express (API layer)
* Python (Signal Processing & ML layer)
* NumPy / SciPy (Signal filtering)
* scikit-learn (Regression models)
* TensorFlow / PyTorch (Advanced modeling optional)
* PostgreSQL or MongoDB (Data storage)
* Redis (Caching recent measurements)

* Raw PPG signal array
* Timestamp
* User metadata (optional)

Returns:

* systolic (number)
* diastolic (number)
* hr (number)
* hrv (number)
* riskScore (number)
* confidence (number)
* recommendation (string)

---

### GET /api/trend/:userId

Returns:

* 7-day trend data
* Risk progression
* Baseline comparison

---

### POST /api/lifestyle

Accepts:

* Sleep hours
* Activity metrics
* Sodium classification
* Screen time data

Returns:

---

## Validation Strategy

Validation includes:

* Paired digital cuff measurements
* Correlation coefficient analysis
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE) calculation
Continuing and completing the cleaned 
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) calculation
* Confidence interval reporting

Evaluation metrics used:

* Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R)
* Mean Absolute Error (mmHg)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Each blood pressure estimate is returned with a confidence score to promote transparency and responsible usage.

## Data Handling & Privacy

COR prioritizes responsible data management.

* No raw video data is stored
* Only processed signal features are retained
* Sensitive user data is encrypted at rest
* Secure API communication (HTTPS)
* User-identifiable data separated from signal data
* Designed with GDPR-aligned principles

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/cor-backend.git](https://github.com/your-username/cor-backend.git)
cd cor-backend

Install Node dependencies:

npm install

Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## Running the Server

Start development server:

npm run dev

The server runs on:

[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## Error Handling

* Structured API error responses
* Validation for malformed signal data
* Confidence threshold detection
* Fallback recommendations if signal quality is low

If signal quality is insufficient, the API returns:

* Low confidence score
* Prompt to re-measure

---

## Limitations

* PPG-based estimation is influenced by lighting conditions and finger placement
* Accuracy depends on calibration dataset quality
* Not validated for clinical diagnosis
* Requires further large-scale clinical validation for commercial deployment
